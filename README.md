## 📌 Project Description:
This is my mini-project where I have created a virtual air canvas using Python. In this project, I use my hand (index finger) to draw in the air and the computer detects it using the webcam. It's like magic—no mouse or stylus is needed!

I used **MediaPipe** to detect the hand and **OpenCV** to draw. You can choose different colors like blue, green, red, yellow. Also, there's a "CLEAR" button to erase the screen.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used:
- Python
- OpenCV (for image processing)
- MediaPipe (for hand tracking)
- NumPy

---

## ✨ Features:
- Draw using index finger.
- Change drawing color by pointing to color boxes.
- Clear the screen by pointing to the “CLEAR” box.
- Works in real-time using webcam.

## 📷 How It Works:
1. Open your webcam.
2. Move your index finger in the air to draw.
3. Point to the colored boxes at the top to change color.
4. Point to "CLEAR" to erase everything.

## ▶️ How to Run:
1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```
   pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```
   python air_canvas.py
   ```
4. Press **‘q’** to quit.
